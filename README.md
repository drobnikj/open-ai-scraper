# GPT Scraper

The GPT Scraper is a powerful tool that leverages OpenAI's API to modify text or HTML obtained from a scraper.
This means that you can use the scraper to extract content from a website, and then pass that content to the OpenAI API to make the magic.

## Limits

The models itself have a limit of number of tokens they can handle, but there is option to overcome this limit.
You can check the limits for each model on the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).
